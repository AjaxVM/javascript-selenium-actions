# javascript-selenium-actions
Test repo to try to run Selenium tests in Github Actions



# Steps
Will need to install chromedriver in the action I guess
Might need Chrome itself installed as well

Currently trying to run dev server as a spawn - but feel a bit funky about it

Need to figure out how to configure the setup file per test type maybe
